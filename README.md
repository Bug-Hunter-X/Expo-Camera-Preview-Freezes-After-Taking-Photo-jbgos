# Expo Camera Preview Freeze Bug

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered when using the Expo `Camera` API. After capturing an image, the camera preview occasionally freezes, rendering the component unresponsive.  This issue necessitates a full application restart to restore functionality.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Run the application using Expo Go or a similar method.
4. Take several photos using the application.
5. Observe if the camera preview freezes after taking a photo. The problem's intermittent nature may require multiple attempts.

## Potential Causes

This problem might stem from issues with asynchronous operations, state management within the camera component, or interactions with other Expo modules.  This repository provides a starting point for identifying and resolving the underlying cause.
